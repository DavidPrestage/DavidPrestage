I built this website using Jekyll as it is hosted on Github pages, and this is what they use for their own static sites. I created the website and pushed it to Github rather than using one of their standard themes. 

There was a great deal of troubleshooting required to get it all working. I learnt a lot about file structures and I got an understanding of Jekyll and Github pages work.

I'm looking forward to filling out this website with further projects.
