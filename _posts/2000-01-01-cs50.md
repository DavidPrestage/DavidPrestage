Unfortunately I can't share code from problem sets due to course policy.

CS50 is a well thought of introductory course to computer science, it is made up of problem sets and labs in C, Python, and SQL.

Notable problems were:
* Creating a hash map using an array of linked lists in C, in order to use this for a spellchecking system
* Writing a program in Python to identify the longest run of consecutive repeats of short sequences of base letters of DNA, then comparing this to a file storing possible owners to make a match on this basis
